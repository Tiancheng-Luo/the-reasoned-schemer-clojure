# reasoned-schemer-clj

The book "The Reasoned Schemer" has inspired the development of Core Logic and is reported to be one of the best tutorial to get familiar with Core Logic. Unfortunately the examples are in Scheme and not in Clojure. Although it is meant to be easy to translate one into the other it is nice to have access to a cheat sheet if you're starting. I couldn't find any comprehensive examples anywhere so I decide to try the exercises myself and post them on Github as I go along.

It's far from complete or perfect but I'm interested on feedback from Clojurians who went through the same experience (especially on the examples that do not work exactly like the book). Let me know if you found examples for which you have a more accurate translation.

All the examples are under: [src/reasoned_schemer_clj/core.clj](https://github.com/matlux/the-reasoned-schemer-clojure/blob/master/src/reasoned_schemer_clj/core.clj)

You can find the differences between The Reasoned Schemer and Clojure under:
